                            gypsies. They are 4-wheeler vehicles and 6 people with 2 children can go for a safari in a jeep.
                            It is better to book a jeep just for 4 people so that you can enjoy a comfortable ride. However,
                            it can only be booked for 1 person but he/she needs to pay the full amount of the safari.
