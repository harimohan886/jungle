                        <p>A safari in <b>Gir National Park </b>is a fun ride and people enjoy it a lot. Gir National Park
                            is
                            the only
                            place in the World where one can spot Asiatic Lions roaming freely in their natural habitat.
                            Wildlife enthusiasts especially come here to see lions from different parts of the World. This
                            park
                            is famous around the World because of its Asiatic Lions. It is located in Gujarat and people who
                            come here can enjoy a jeep safari in the wild area.
                        </p>
                        <p>People can enjoy a jeep safari in the wild area of Gir National Park and this is the only
                            permitted
                            option by the forest department to explore this park. It is advised for people who come here to
                            book
                            their jeep safari in advance because the tourism pressure is very much on this park. Even the
                            department has made a Devalia safari park which is a fenced area in this park to enjoy a ride
                            and to
                            decrease the pressure on the Gir National Park. Other than these two, people can also enjoy a
                            safari
                            ride towards Kankai Mata Temple or Girnar Hills.

                        <p>This park does not have different zones as people come here to spot Asiatic Lions and they can be
                            found anywhere inside the park. However, the Giz Interpretation zone and Kankai Temple of this
                            park have different routes than the normal safari rides so people can book their safari for them
                            if they want another chance to spot lions here. At a distance, Girnar Hills are also located
                            which allows safari in it. In simple words, people can book a safari for Gir National Park, Gir
                            Interpretation Zone (Devalia), Girnar, or Kankai Temple. </p>
